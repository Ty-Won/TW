<!-- Small description of your goal and beliefs-->
<div class="goal">
    <p>
        Mars. Flying cars. Iron man suits.
        From 
        I aspire to be part of a movement with one goal in mind: Change the world.
        To think of new things that change how we think and live is my goal. Some technology has been
        stagnant for many years and we as engineers,scientists or even young ambitious kids owe 
        it to ourselves to seize opportunities to solve problems
        and create amazing things......
